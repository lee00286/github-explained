## What is an Action

[GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions) allows you to create and automate SDLC workflows in your repository.

Various actions can be combined to create a custom workflow. Workflow is custom automated process that you can set up in your repository.

GitHub Actions allows you to build end-to-end CI and CD capabilities in your repository. CI([Continuous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/about-continuous-integration)) is a software practice that should be commited to a shared repository frequently.

## How to Begin

If none of the workflows is added to your repository, you might want to use workflow templates.

### Add Workflow Template

Navigate to **Actions** category in your repository. Then, you will see the message:

> Get started with GitHub Actions

Below the message, you would see various suggested or popular workflows listed. If there's any template you'd like to use, then click **Set up this workflow** under the name of the template.

If you want to use your own workflow, then click **set up a workflow yourself**. Then, you will be able to use GitHub Action through stored workflows in `.github/workflows` directory.
